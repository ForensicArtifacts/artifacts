name: KubernetesClusterDatabase
doc: |
  Kubernetes cluster (etcd) database.

  The cluster database is hosted within a Pod and can be configured to be
  deployed as distributed environment or single intance. The database is
  mounted from the local file system into the corresponding containers
  scheduled by a pod.

  The database contains information about the clusters state, deployed
  resourcees and also deleted components.

  Installation path of the (Kubernetes) Kubelet component.

  This component is installed on all nodes that are member of a Kubernetes cluster.

sources:
- type: PATH
  attributes: {paths: ['/var/lib/kubelet/pods']}
supported_os: [Linux]
---
name: KubernetesKubeletPodManifest
doc: |
  Manifest file that has been used to deploy a (Kubernetes) Pod.

  The manifest contains the Pods specification.
sources:
- type: FILE
  attributes: {paths: ['/etc/kubernetes/manifests/*.yaml']}
supported_os: [Linux]
---
name: KubernetesKubeletPodContainer
doc: |
  Path where the container resources created within a (Kubernetes) Pod are located.

  The paths naming would explain as the following:
  '/var/lib/kubelet/pods/<pod_id>/containers/<container_name>/*'

  The Pod itself gets created/scheduled by the Kubelet component. The path
  'containers/' does contain a directory for each container scheduled in that
  Pod. In each of that path there is a file located that gets mounted into
  the container at '/dev/termination-log'.

  This is the logfile that stores termination information in case a container
  terminates. The pod identifier of that file can be correlated to the container
  runtime installed on the host to find out the mount configuration.

- type: PATH
  attributes: {paths: ['/var/lib/kubelet/pods/*/containers']}
supported_os: [Linux]
urls: ['https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#container-v1-core']
---
name: KubernetesKubeletPodVolumes
doc: |
  Volumes and other objects that are mounted into a (Kubernetes) Pod and respectively into the scheduled container(s).

  The type of volumes (or objects) are identified by the name appended to a tilde.

  Examples:
  * 'volumes/kubernetes.io~projected' -> describes a projected volume
  * 'volumes/kubernetes.io~configmap' -> describes a Kubernetes ConfigMap resource

---
name: KubernetesKubeletPodLogs
doc: |
  Location where the log data of (Kubernetes) Pods can be found.

  The path's name would contain the following elements:
  '/var/log/pods/<namespace>_<pod_name>_<pod_id>/<container_name>/<num>.log'
  Includes also redirected stdout, stderr and (if applicable) stdin of container executions.
