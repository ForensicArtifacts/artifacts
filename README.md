## Digital Forensics Artifact Repository Artifact Repository

A free, community-sourced, machine-readable knowledge base of digital forensic
artifacts that the world can use both as an information source and within other
tools.

If you'd like to use the artifacts in your own tools, **all you need to be able
to do is read YAML**. That's it, no other dependencies. The Python code in
this project is just used to validate all the artifacts to make sure they
follow the specfication.

## Background/History

The [ForensicArtifacts.com](http://forensicartifacts.com/) artifact repository
was forked from the [GRR project](https://github.com/google/grr) artifact
collection into a stand-alone repository that is not tool-specific. The GRR
developers have migrated to using this repository and make contributions here. In
addition the ForensicArtifact team will begin backfilling artifacts in the new
format from the [ForensicArtifacts.com](http://forensicartifacts.com/) website.

For some background on the artifacts system and how we expect it to be used see
[this blackhat presentation](https://www.blackhat.com/us-14/archives.html#grr-find-all-the-badness-collect-all-the-things)
and [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ren6QSvwFvg) from the GRR team.
