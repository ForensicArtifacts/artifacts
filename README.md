## Digital Forensics Artifacts Repository

A free, community-sourced, machine-readable knowledge base of digital forensic
artifacts that the world can use both as an information source and within other
tools.

If you'd like to use the artifacts in your own tools, **all you need to be able
to do is read YAML**. That is it, no other dependencies. The Python code in
this project is just used to validate all the artifacts to make sure they
follow the specification.
